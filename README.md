# Compressed Sensing for Rasberry Pi


Pi Zero uses compressed sensing techniques to select few random samples of recordings from a microphone flying with a drone. Pi saves these samples as compressed data and uploads them to Google Drive. In Google Drive, compressed data can be downloaded from a computer and use some recovery algorithms to reconstruct the original signal.
