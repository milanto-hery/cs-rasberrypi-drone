*Compresse Sensing for Rasberry Pi*
A Pi Zero is using compressed sensing technique to select a few random samples of recordings flying with a drone and save the outputs and upload them into google drive. Inside the google drive the compressed data can be downloaded from a computer and using some recovery algorithms to reconstruct the original data.
